## Election-Audit Summary: 
The attached script can be modified in different ways and can be used to audit other elections.
1) The county variables can be modified to a generic location/area variable and the script can be used to audit not only county but also state elections
2) The script can also be updated to see the candidate vote count and percentage by county to see how many counties the candidate won
3) If we have additional data regarding the type of vote, further analysis on how many votes were cast by mail vs punch card vs electronic reader can be done
